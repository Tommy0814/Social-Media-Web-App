Click All posts to see all the posts posted by all users, click load more to load more pictures posted by other users, the reason for this feature is to avoid loading all the pictures from other users to the website, because it will cost excessive internet usage if there are too many users.

Click my post to view my post, if there is no pictures posted, it will be blank, click Choose File button to choose the picture to upload. After uploading the picture, a success notification will appear. Pictures will appear immediately after being uploaded.

In All Posts to view the posts posted by all the users, the post time and user name are all shown below the image, as required in the requirement.
